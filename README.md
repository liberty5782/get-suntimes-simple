A proof of concept more than anything else -- a simple python script for getting sunrise and sunset times for a given location.
Uses https://api.sunrisesunset.io/json? for sun info and https://geocoding-api.open-meteo.com/v1/search for location info.

To use, just run with python3: `python3 get-suntimes.py` and follow the prompts.
